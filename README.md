# WorkTracker App -- Final Project #

## Description ##

I made this custom app for my Dad who owns a contractor business. He has a unique way of keeping up with work that is in dire need of updating. This application will allow him to create new jobsites then within each jobsite he can list the work he has done. There is also a way to add workers to each job and they will only show if they are assigned to that job. There are navigation links on top to easily go back to the list of all jobsites.

## Application Function ##

This is a full stack app that uses RESTFUL routes with MongoDB to track work done at multiple jobsites. It uses multiple technologies to complete all its functions:

* HTML5
* CSS
* JavaScript
* Express.js
* Nodejs
* React.js
* Axios
* Mongoose
* MongoDB
* Heroku

The back end api part of this project is hosted on heroku and is fully independent from the front part of the app. You can use this link to go to the application:

[Work Tracker App](https://worktrackerapp.herokuapp.com/)

When you open the app it should look like this:

You can then click on any of the names and it wil take you to another page that will show you the work done for that person and the workers that worked on that job.

## Reflection ##

This was a very interesting app to build for me because it will be used to help someone close to me with their business records. Going forward there are a few features I would like to add. The main feature being authentication and authorization so it can be distributed. I would also like to add theme packs that can be selected based on user input so they can choose between several preset themes.
